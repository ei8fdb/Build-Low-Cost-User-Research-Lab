Technical details of each options

Lab tiers, different options as differentiated

by price and functionality

In this exercise the different styles of lab that might be acquired have been broken down into 4

approximate levels. These range from tier 1, which would be expected to come in at between

£4,000 and £8,000, but not in excess of £10,000. Tier 2 offers more functionality and a greater

range of options for integrating a larger number of feeds and a better range of viewing solutions

in the viewing areas. Tier 3 offers a large number of features and can easily support the testing

of different types of device, including mobiles. In addition, a set up at this cost level will probably

be able to include features like eyeball tracking and large screen(s) in the viewing area. Tier 4

represents the most sophisticated lab solution; this is likely to be hardware based with many

cameras, with pan and tilt functions, large screens, the ability to support testing of many

different types of mobile devices.

Tier 1 lab (Capital cost up to £10,000)

There are a considerable number of viable options for this level of price, from pure software

through to lower end hardware solutions, hardware can be simpler, but software can often

provide very similar functionality at the lower end of the price point.

Key components:

 Some kind of studio software e.g. Camtasia / Morae / lower end hardware mixer.

 PC or Mac testing device in the lab / testing room space.

 PC for streaming and viewing in the viewing room.

 Camera or web cam and or document cam

 Adobe Connect

 Peripherals

 Capture card and splitter for certain hardware implementations

 Splitters, switches and mixers for the hardware style solutions.

 Recorders and encoders (for the hardware solutions)

Setup

The key attributes for this minimalist solution are that it will have the ability to capture the

screen, either of a mobile device under test, or of the screen of the test PC / Mac. In addition, a

separate feed would record the participant as she or he navigated the service or produce under

test. Audio of the session would also be captured for analysis by the observers in a different

room, either in real-time or subsequently. The heart of the configuration would be a space

Security marking

4

where a user, researcher and any assistive personnel would test a product and an observation

or viewing space, where other researchers and stakeholders could experience the session. In

this lower end specification, the main viewing equipment would be the monitor screen, and the

test device would be the PC or Mac. It is likely that this would limit the size of the viewing area,

as a standard screen only has so much viewable space, which would in turn restrict the number

of users who could observe.

Ideally, this setup would support the capacity to stream the outcomes of test sessions to remote

locations. This would allow stakeholders who could not be physically present to gain the

benefits virtually.

General benefits and drawbacks

Obviously there are a range of advantages, depending on whether a hardware or software

solutions are preferred, labs in this cost range will tend to have similar kinds of functions,

benefits and hindrances, but there are some differences between hardware and software

oriented solutions, so the specific benefits and hindrances are outlined below, followed by a

summary of these for all labs within this kind of pricing range.

Software solution benefits:

 A key benefit is the cost of the setup, a lot of functionality is gained for a relatively

modest price.

 The solutions especially tend to be simple and easy to set up and to use, which is a key

advantage over more expensive implementations.

 Another advantage is that this kind of set up is relatively portable, so that it would be

relatively easy to reconfigure the rooms or take equipment to other locations.

 Markers can be added to videos relatively easily as the session proceeds; in addition,

videos can be relatively easily edited afterwards.

 Videos are available at the end of the session and can be saved either locally or to a

cloud based storage solution.

 Can support PIP and different types of device testing (apart from very cheapest

solutions)

Software solution drawbacks:

 May be less stable due to software and driver updates.

 Local and web based streaming of limited quality (SD only)

 Certain configurations limit the number of feeds that can be processed.

For the hardware based solutions in this price bracket, the following points summarise the key

benefits and drawbacks of the hardware oriented solutions.

Hardware solution benefits:

 Once installed the hardware solution is simple to use and operate.

 The fact that the setup exploits hardware makes the arrangement more stable and

reliable.

 Recordings would normally be available immediately following the conclusion of a

research session.

 Sessions can be viewed in HD from remote locations.

 Sessions can be recorded locally or to the cloud via a content delivery network (CDN).

Software solution drawbacks:

 Solution is relatively inflexible and has limited portability.

 Depending on exact configuration, there can be limits to the video quality.

 Can add timestamps to the video but there are limitations on being able to add real-time

flags.

 Need a separate device to edit the footage after the session.

Note that in the above solution it is possible to replace the dedicated hardware video recorder

with a capture card and software recorded. This provides similar benefits to the solution outlined

above, but it has the drawback of taking longer to produce the finished videos.

Comments

Any one of these solutions would fulfil the most basic requirements of the user researcher in

terms of lab based research. Given that these are the most economical solutions they would

also provide space in any budget to address issues like furnishings, lab space and accessibility.

For the purposes of comparison, it is worth noting that HMRC have favoured the higher end

software solution, which would exploit a solution like Morae to capture the screen and the

participant reaction. This would also leave them some budget available for changes to rooms,

accessibility etc.

In our consultations with experts at City Labs and Google there was a general deprecation of

the software based solutions in favour of the hardware based solutions with the feeling that

these latter solutions offered better reliability, expandability and quality. This wasn’t a total

opposition to software, especially in situations of constrained budget, just a preference for more

hardware.

It is worth acknowledging that if we were looking at a budget which would expect to be repaid

from savings over a 12 month period, it is likely, especially in conjunction with budget that would

need to be reserved for accommodation, furnishings and any access requirements that we’d

Security marking

6

probably be looking at this sort of budget level. One unanticipated benefit of this sort of

approach would be if we could synchronise our equipment with HMRC, this would allow us to

benefit from any procurement work they’d already undertaken and would facilitate any cross

government cooperation between Home Office and HMRC user researchers.

Tier 2 lab (Capital costs of between £10,000 and £40,000)

This level of solution is likely to be a hybrid between a software and hardware solution, but

increasingly, there are hardware solutions available that will do the job for much lower prices

that were once the case. For example, Google has a mobile lab, which gives them much of the

functionality of the full size lab, but at around £20,000. The key difference with this kind of setup

is that you lost a lot of the nice to have features, the pan and title cameras and extra angles,

some of the quality in the video.

Key components:

 Testing computers PC / Mac / laptop

 Some kind of video hub capable of mixing and encoding and P in P

 Converters, splitters and senders

 Visualiser / document cam and gooseneck

 Online streaming

 Local streaming

 HD peripherals

 Some furnishings and furniture

 Device for editing / storage

Setup

This setup would allow the user’s interaction with the service on the desktop or laptop to be

captured, or in the alternative via the mobile devices. A sufficiently capable video hub would

allow 3 feeds to be mixed, perhaps showing the screen, the user’s face and a broader shot and

similarly, the output from mobile screens could be captured as well.

This would be piped through to an observation room, if the budget allowed, we could have a

one way mirror, but ideally, some sort of large screen to demonstrate to participants and

stakeholders the progress of the usability testing.

We could also use the equipment to stream the results of these sessions to remote users and

stakeholders.

Solution benefits:

 Very flexible set up, can cope with many different input sources

 Stable and reliable broadcast quality

 Recordings could be immediately available after initial setup

 Supports streaming from any location in the world

 Can record locally, or possibly direct to cloud, depending on configuration

 The above can support online archiving and repository building.

Software solution drawbacks:

 May not be possible to add real-time flags or markers

 More complicated for users to operate

 More expensive than the simplest solution

 Require other computer for storage and or editing.

Comments

This setup provides a good compromise between the most basic setups and the more

sophisticated ones which are highlighted below. Without getting absurdly expensive the solution

allows for multiple different feeds, p in p and good quality video. In addition this would look and

feel more like a lab than the most basic solutions and could, depending on how configured, give

researchers a good range of options and devices on which to test.

Financially, even at the higher end of the spending envelope, we’d expect the investment to pay

for itself within about two years at the maximum from money spent on the procurement of

external labs. In addition, we’d also realise productivity and efficiency savings as researchers

could get into the lab more often, test more frequently and projects without dedicated test

budgets could still benefit.

This solution, as a hardware version would also be more reliable and stable than some software

alternatives and once configured could be run fairly easily by researchers. Clearly though, there

would be some need to have support and repair arrangements in place

Tier 3 lab (Capital costs of between £50,000 and £80,000)

This level of investment would normally furnish a largely hardware solution, albeit one that isn’t

perhaps quite as highly specified as tier 4 which is outlined below. An example of this type of

lab would be the Google UX lab on Buckingham Palace Road, Victoria, which in today’s money

Security marking

8

would cost between £70,000 and £80,000 and this would probably fulfil all the needs that we

would have from a UX lab. The only downside is that this configuration puts more limits on

expandability, though in our case, this might not be an enormous limitation.

 Small number of pan and tilt cameras, or larger number of fixed

 AV rack with recorder, mixer, router and switches

 Controller

 Testing devices

 Screens for test room and viewing room

 Storage

 Test machines

 A gooseneck camera of visualiser

 Streaming capabilities

 Eye tracking at higher cost bracket end

 Equivalents to Mirror Op and Apple TV

 Furniture and furnishings

Setup

This setup would mirror the ones already described in that we’d have the test devices and

whatever furnishings in one room, where the testing was taking place. The feeds from the

cameras and the screen would then be passed through a mixer / recorder to give us the

combined feed in the observation area, this could be recorded as was, or the feeds edited

together later on a separate machine. A setup as advanced as this could support multiple feeds

from different cameras and different angles and with appropriate configuration could work with

real-time marking.

Again, depending on the fabric budget, it may be possible to arrange a one way mirror as part of

this solution and it would definitely be possible to stream the output to remote viewers in

different locations. This step though, would require some configuration and setup first.

Solution benefits

 Very flexible set up, can cope with many different input sources

 Stable and reliable broadcast quality

 Recordings could be immediately available after initial setup

Security marking

 Supports streaming from any location in the world

 Can record locally, or possibly direct to cloud, depending on configuration

 The above can support online archiving and repository building.

 Larger range of cameras give better research options

 High quality recordings

 Once set up and configured, should be easy for researchers to exploit.

Solution drawbacks

 More complicated for users to operate if it has not been already set up

 Arguably, this gives us too much in the way of features, it is too advanced.

 This solution is much more expensive and would require more support.

 Other computers are required for editing and storage.

 Solution would take longer to pay for itself than some of the other options

 More space required and less mobile than some of the other solutions on offer.

Comments

This setup is in many respects a cut down version of the deluxe option in that it is hardware

based, provides high quality local storage and is largely automated. The lack of expandability

and some of the bells and whistles of the top class option do differentiate them, but in all

honesty, in an ideal world, it would be extremely hard to justify spending double this amount for

the top class options, unless perhaps it was thought that we would be expanding in the near

future.

In terms of return on investment, this is about the maximum we’d be wanting to spend.

Hypothetically, a capital cost of c. £60,000 could be paid for within three years if it allowed us to

cut all external lab spending. Equally, greater productivity supported by more ready access to

labs and simply put, more testing, would add to the financial rationale.

This solution, as a hardware version would also be more reliable and stable than some software

alternatives and once configured could be run fairly easily by researchers. Clearly though, there

would be some need to have support and repair arrangements in place.

Tier 4 lab (Capital costs in excess of £80,000)

Security marking

10

This level of spending would buy a really highly specified lab. Many of the government labs and

private labs from 2 or 3 years previously which are class leaders came in at around this level of

spending, for example Google (including building fabric) was c. £140,000 and GDS c. £190,000

or the DVLA £250,000. The components would also be dedicated solutions with high quality

individual hardware.

Key components

 Multi pan-tilt cameras capable of being controlled remotely.

 AV rack with scaler, router, switch and router and recording devices

 Controllers

 Set of mobile devices for testing (tablets / phones / etc)

 Large size screens for the viewing room

 Large screen, smart TV for test room

 Device for file management

 Large capacity local storage solution

 Mac and PC test station set up

 Furnishing and furniture for the test room

 2 Gooseneck cameras for the observation room

 Streaming capability

 Apple TV and Mirror Op for mobile testing (or equivalent)

 Accessibility kit, induction loop, keyboard, joystick and software.

 Tobii eye tracking

 Full HD video capability.

 Maximum expandability to support offshoot satellite labs.

Setup

This setup would mirror the ones already described in that we’d have the test devices and

whatever furnishings in one room, where the testing was taking place. The feeds from the

cameras and the screen would then be passed through a mixer / recorder to give us the

combined feed in the observation area, this could be recorded as was, or the feeds edited

together later on a separate machine. A setup as advanced as this could support multiple feeds

from different cameras and different angles and with appropriate configuration could work with

real-time marking.

Security marking

11

This would also have the highest level of support, so we could have large screens in the viewing

room to show the video as it comes from the testing area. In addition, we’d have the best levels

of furnishings and different kinds of environments and devices. In addition, this setup would be

the most like a traditional lab of all and would undoubtedly impress participants and external

stakeholders alike with its sophistication and professional standard.

Solution benefits

 Maximal flexibility, can cope with a huge range of setups.

 High quality HD recordings.

 Recordings could be immediately available after initial setup

 Supports streaming from any location in the world

 Can record locally, or possibly direct to cloud, depending on configuration

 The above can support online archiving and repository building.

 Huge range of cameras allow researchers to set up the room for great range of

scenarios.

 Once set up and configured, should be easy for researchers to exploit.

 The lab is of sufficient specification to justify it being hired out to third party users.

Solution drawbacks

 More complicated for users to operate if it has not been already set up

 Arguably, this gives us too much in the way of features, it is too advanced.

 This solution is much more expensive and would require more support.

 Other computers are required for editing and storage.

 Solution would take longer to pay for itself than some of the other options, on some

estimates, up to ten years, too long to make a realistic business case in most

circumstances.

 More space required and less mobile than some of the other solutions on offer.

 If preset capture options aren’t used then editing takes a long time afterwards.

 If the lab were hired out, there would be potential issues around competition and state

aids, especially in central London which is already well supplied with commercial labs.

This level of solution would clearly fulfil all of our requirements and possible more. It should be

noted that this level of lab has been installed at GDS, DVLA and is being installed at DWP. It

would certainly give the Home Office a capability equivalent to those organisations and would

give us the ability to store research at high quality for some time.

As a hardware solution there would be minimal input from user researchers to keeping the lab

running and the lack of updates and driver replacements should aid reliability. However, this

level of investment would need servicing and it would need support which would have to come

for the only undertaking on the framework, DMS, at additional and ongoing cost. There might

even be an argument to suggest that maximising the return on investment would justify the

employment of a full time studio manager, as at GDS, though the DVLA do manage without

one.

Ultimately, a spend at this level would be hard to justify because it would take a great deal of

time to pay for itself. We might profit from improved productivity that better and quicker lab

access guaranteed, but ultimately as a cash investment, return will take a long time. The other

labs of this specification that exist in government e.g. GDS and DVLA, seem to have been the

result of a conscious decision and buy in at board and exec level within those organisations. A

lab of this quality is more capable of generating a passive income through leasing it out to third

parties, but we’d have to be very careful on this because of EU restrictions on competition and

state aid.

It is hard to justify spending this much on a setup when we could achieve 80% of the required

outcome for much less investment.

Conclusions

Security marking

13

The precise level of investment depends on the appetite for lab space and the level of ambition

we have. In standard business case terms we’d normally want any investment to pay for itself

within five years and preferably sooner, indeed, the two year mark might be a more ambitious

target.

If we contrast our aspirations with what other government agencies have embarked on, an

interesting dichotomy emerges. On the one hand, we have HMRC who have gone for a

relatively basic but inexpensive solution, that will get them some different camera angles and

feeds and support testing of other devices. On the other hand, we have DVLA, GDS and DWP

who have gone for the very highly specified labs, all procured from DMS via the framework. The

only exception to this triumvirate was the GDS lab which was procured prior to the advent of the

framework.

All of these labs are relatively recent additions and it is uncertain at this stage how productive

the investment will turn out to be. The GDS lab was supposed to pay for itself within two years,

but their requirements are somewhat different to ours in that they have made more use of

external lab time. In addition, GDS is believed to be intending to expand and we would expect to

be able to access their lab(s) for the foreseeable future. This means that should we need

access to a very highly specified lab in future, we would probably almost always be able to

utilise the GDS one, albeit that the wait might be significant.

On this basis we can rule out the top tier option, unless there are strong reasons for supposing

that we need this high level of specification, which do not seem to be pressing at this stage, we

can save ourselves a lot of money. It’s worth noting that the Google fixed lab, which while

slightly lower spec than the DMS tier 4 option actually to all intents and purposes delivers nearly

everything that the higher tier one does. As we noted, this cost around £100,000, but their

technical expert has grounds to believe that this could be reduced to around £70,000 with

today’s equipment. This would give us near tier 4 quality at less than half the price.

However, the tier 2 option also provides much of the same functionality at again, nearly half the

price of the tier 3 option. We lost the pan and tilt remote control options, but we keep a lot of the

other features and what is more, it’s east to operate once it has been set up and configured. We

should be able to gain nearly all the insight that the more expensive lab gives, at a fraction of

the price. As we stated, the Google mobile lab is sufficient for most of their test requirements

and we’d probably be getting something very similar to that for that price. Equally, we’d have the

option of exploiting the GDS lab(s) should there be a need for some very heavy testing of a

service.

The simplest option is still an option, and it would still give us a lot of options even with just that.

There are good grounds for favouring the slightly more sophisticated solution though, in terms

of the number of feeds and the hardware solution that provides pre-done mixing. We could also

add more cameras to that setup should the need arise. Nevertheless, if we wanted to play it

safe, we’d certainly get a lot of functionality from the tier 1 option and it would be certainly quite

quick and easy to build, and probably procure when compared to the other alternatives.

Overall though, the recommendation would be for the tier 2 lab as a starting point. It gives us

more stability, more flexibility and some expandability for a price much lower that other

Security marking

14

government departments have spent. If we could get a strategic partner though, we might want

to be more ambitious and to explore whether there is any scope for trying to realise tier 3, which

would give us near tier 4 features for half the price.
