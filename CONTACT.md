# How can I get in touch?

## I have something to contribute to this project
Great! If you've got some suggestions on alternative equipment, alternative ways to setup the equipment, or different things you've done, have some questions, queries or are unsure of some detail then the best way to contribute is to open a [Github issue](https://github.com/ei8fdb/Home-Office-User-Research-Studios/issues/new) and start chatting there.

## I don't have a Github account
If you don't have a Github account, or can't discuss it on Github, then get in touch with me via email on bernardtyers AT acm DOT org.

I'm also on Twitter, [@bernardtyers](https://twitter.com/bernardtyers).
