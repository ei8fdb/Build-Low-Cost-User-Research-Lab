## Internet access
You cannot access the Internet from the observation room WiFi network. If you need Internet access you should use GovWiFi.

## Testing a prototype
It is the project team's responsibility to arrange access to the service they are testing.

The ideal situation is the prototype is hosted on the Internet, for example using a service like Heroku or similar.

### Prototypes hosted on the Internet
For services which are accessible on the internet, this won’t be a problem as the main testing computer has access to the Internet.

If you need to access your service via a whitelist of IP addresses please contact the lab team.

### Prototypes privately hosted
The lab was designed with the expectation most services being tested would be accessed via the web.

If your prototype is not available on the Internet, you'll need to speak to the lab team to work out details.

## Who is responsibile for what
The project researcher will be responsible for testing the website is available from the research studio, running the session, downloading their videos and securing the room at the end of the session.

Our advice is if you haven’t used the kit before book a test session to make sure you can use the kit and that it is producing the output that you need.

If you have any issues, then please contact the lab champions who will be able to support you.

## Default setup
The equipment has been set up with 2 default settings one for the classic lab arrangement where we have 2 cameras, one recording the face, the other the room and the screen of the test PC being recorded.

The second arrangement is for mobile testing, where we record the mobile device under test as well as the participant’s face and the room.

These are preset in the Pearl device, selecting classic lab or mobile test will result in the desired output automatically being streamed to the viewing screen and being recorded to the Pearl once the system is switched on (see guidance below).

If you wish to use one of these presets, please ensure that the kit has been positioned in the appropriate space for that arrangement - see the lab arrangement guidelines below.
