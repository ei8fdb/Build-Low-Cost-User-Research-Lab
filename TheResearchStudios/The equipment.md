## Epiphan Pearl
The Epiphan Pearl ("The Pearl") is the brains of our setup. Technically, it is a video switcher with live streaming and recording.

You can create custom "picture in picture" layouts from up to four HD video sources, along with audio.

You can record these video layouts, while simultaneously streaming 1080p video streams at high quality.

The Pearl can store approximately 1,000 1-hour long video sessions.

If more video sessions need to be stored, the Pearl has USB connections so external storage can be connected.


## Buffalo Drivestation 4TB USB hard disk (Optional)
Using an external USB storage device is optional - if you do not need to store a lot of video them you can ignore this step.

We chose the [Buffalo Drivestation 4TB hard disk](http://www.buffalotech.com/products/drivestation) for the storage vs. price value. **Any USB storage device can be used.**

We used a USB storage device as:

- it provided a place to backup research videos in case anything happened the Pearl
- we expect create a lot of video files and the Pearl may not be able to store them all

### Configure the Pearl for using USB storage
You can configure the Pearl via the web interface to use USB storage.


## Go Pro Hero camera
We needed a way to record video images of 1) the participant's facial expressions ("The FaceCam"), and the facilitator, participant's discussion in the seating area ("ChairCam").

Our requirements for recording video were to be able to:

- power the camera from USB cable (connected to main power)
- output the video feed, in realtime, from the camera into the Pearl

We purchased 3 GoPro Hero 3 cameras as they had a micro-HDMI video out and could be powered with a mini-USB cable plugged into power.

There are newer models released already so don't worry about getting this particular model.

### Don't use a memory card with the GoPro
The most important thing to remember is: you do not need to use a memory card with the camera.

The camera will not be recording any video - it will go directly to the Pearl.

### Mounting the GoPro in a case

As mentioned above, we need to 1) output the GoPro video to the Pearl and 2) power the GoPro from the USB port.

To allow us do this we purchased the [GoPro Skeleton Housing](https://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/accessories-2/skeleton-housing/AHSSK-301.html) for each camera. These are camera cases with holes cut out for the cables already.

You can see how the cables are connected to the GoPro in figure 2 below. They make your life much easier.

We then connected the camera to the [GoPro Swivel Mount](https://shop.gopro.com/mounts/swivel-mount/ABJQR-001.html) and the [GoPro Curved Flat Adhesive mount](https://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/mounts/curved-plus-flat-adhesive-mounts/AACFT-001.html) to stick the camera to the table once we had positioned it.

This allowed us to change the point of view of the camera, but keep it secure.


## IPEVO VZ-1 VGA/USB Dual-Mode Document camera
The [IPEVO VZ-1 camera](https://www.ipevo.com/prods/IPEVO-VZ-1-HD-VGA-USB-Document-Camera) is a document camera (sometimes called a "visualiser").

It is a real-time image capture camera - it allows you to put something on the table and then top display it on a computer screen.

During user research sessions we sometimes need to test with things which are not on computer such as:

- paper documents (e.g. letters, visa papers)
- identify documents (e.g. passports, driving license)
- emails participants receive
- participants own mobile phones, tablet, etc

Similar to the GoPro cameras above, our requirements for the document camera were to be able to:

- power the camera from USB cable (connected to main power)
- output the video feed, in realtime, from the camera into the Pearl

**Fig 3:** Connecting the IPEVO VZ-1 camera to the Pearl

The IPEVO VZ-1 camera can be plugged into a video display (in our example, the Pearl). It is also powered from USB.

The VZ-1 was plugged into one of the Pearl VGA video inputs.

## HDMI Male to Female VGA Adapter Video Converter

**IMPORTANT:** Some devices with HDMI connections require video converters with HDCP support in order to convert from HDMI to VGA. Before you buy a converter check to see if the device you want to convert uses HDCP.

The Pearl has 4 video inputs we can use - 2 VGA and 2 HDMI - this means you can record from 4 video devices.

Because we had 3 HDMI video devices and 1 VGA - our requirements were to:

- convert one GoPro camera HDMI video to VGA
- connect it to the Pearl.

**NB:** GoPro cameras do not use HDCP.

**Fig 4:** Connecting the GoPro camera to the video converter and then to the Pearl

We bought [a HDMI to VGA video adapter](https://www.maplin.co.uk/p/maplin-microministandard-hdmi-male-to-female-vga-adapter-n58nx) and connected the GoPro HDMI output to it, and then connected the VGA output to the Pearl.

This allowed us to use all 4 video devices.
