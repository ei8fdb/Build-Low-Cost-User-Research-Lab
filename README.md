This is a short guide to our approach to build a low-cost user research studio.

Here you'll find information about why we chose to build the studio, the studio setup and equipment used, and helpful documents for running a lab like ours, and lessons we learned.

## Why did we build the user research studio?

The main reasons were to:

1. to increase the amount of research with participants and
2. reduce the amount of spending on commercial research studios.

In order to do that, went out to the user research community inside and outside of government to see how others were doing it.
