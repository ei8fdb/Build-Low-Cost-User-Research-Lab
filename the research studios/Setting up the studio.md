This is a checklist of what to do before and after a user research session. It is mainly to help the lab champions.

## 2-3 days before the research session
- Confirm with the researcher the research is going ahead
- Make sure the researcher has done a pilot with the prototype in the lab. It is their responsibility to make sure it works
- Send them the instructions on how to download their recordings once the sessions are finished

## The morning of the research appointment starts
- Try to get there at least 30-40 mins before the session
- Make sure the lab is open!
- Turn on the testing computer
- Check Internet access is working correctly
- Test that the network connection between the Observation room and the studio is up and working. You can do this by checking one of the streams.

- The last thing to do before the research begins is to turn on the desk microphones. You can leave them turned on until the end of the last research session.

NB: The microphones are battery powered, so don't forget to turn them off at the end of the day.


## At the end of the research
- First thing to do is turn off the microphones!

The equipment has been set up with 2 default settings one for the classic lab arrangement where we have 2 cameras, one recording the face, the other the room and the screen of the test PC being recorded.

The second arrangement is for mobile testing, where we record the mobile device under test as well as the participant’s face and the room.

These are preset in the Pearl device, selecting classic lab or mobile test will result in the desired output automatically being streamed to the viewing screen and being recorded to the Pearl once the system is switched on (see guidance below).

If you wish to use one of these presets, please ensure that the kit has been positioned in the appropriate space for that arrangement - see the lab arrangement guidelines below.

Once you have your cameras set up in the desired format, there are a couple of things to do:

Power on the cameras and test laptop.

Power on the microphones

On the test laptop, extend the display as you would if you were using a projector or second monitor

Ensure that all these are connected to the Pearl and that the Pearl’s own power and internet cables are plugged in.

Make sure the pearl is plugged into an ethernet port and that any researcher’s laptop is connected to the same network if they wish to view the session
