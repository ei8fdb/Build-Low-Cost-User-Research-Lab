### Epiphan Pearl
Test change here
The Epiphan Pearl ("The Pearl") is the brains of our setup. Technically, it is a production video switcher with live streaming and recording.

You can create custom "picture in picture" layouts from up to four HD video sources, along with audio.

You can record these video layouts, while simultaneously streaming 1080p video streams at high quality.

### Go Pro Hero camera
We needed a way to record video images of 1) the participant's facial expressions ("The FaceCam"), and the facilitator, participant's discussion in the seating area ("ChairCam").

Our requirements for recording video were:

- to power the camera from USB cable (connected to main power)
- to output the video feed in realtime from the camera into the Pearl

We purchased 3 GoPro Hero 3 cameras as they had a mini-HDMI video out and could be powered with a USB cable plugged into power.

There are newer models released already so don't worry about getting this particular model.
