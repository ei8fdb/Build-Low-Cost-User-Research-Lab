### Epiphan Pearl
The Epiphan Pearl ("The Pearl") is the brains of our setup. Technically, it is a production video switcher with live streaming and recording.

You can create custom "picture in picture" layouts from up to four HD video sources, along with audio.

You can record these video layouts, while simultaneously streaming 1080p video streams at high quality.

### Go Pro Hero camera
We use the GoPro Hero range of cameras to record video images of 1) the participant's facial expressions ("The FaceCam"), and the discussion in the seating area ("ChairCam").

We purchased 3 GoPro Hero 3 cameras. There are newer models released already.

The main things we needed was:

- to power the camera from USB cable (connected to main power)
- to output the video feed in realtime from the camera into the Pearl

The Hero 3 camera allowed us to do this.
