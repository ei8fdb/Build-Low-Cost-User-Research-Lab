Booking the lab

Things to think about:

-  testing a digital service and interviewing users should always have priority, but it is better that the room is used. If you'd like to use it for other research or design activities, let us know

- any blank lab time is potentially bookable

- organising research is difficult, so try to maximise the use of the lab

- try not to book and cancel at short notice

- the observation room is to be used by project observers, stakeholders, etc. If you have observers visiting, you'll need to book it too

- if you arenâ€™t able to show on the day, this is very wasteful, so please try to ensure, as far as possible that you are able to use any times that you book for

Like a hotel, we get the most value from the lab when it is constantly occupied. :)

## Getting access into the studio and observation room

The studio is normally locked. The observation room will normally be open.

The studio will be opened for you by one of the studio champions, with enough time before your research starts. It's best to organise exact details with them at least 2-3 days before your research starts.

They will also ensure that all kit is still in place after your session. Any losses will be charged to your project.

If you want to check out equipment for mobile testing, then please contact the champion and complete the checkout form in the mobile testing guidance.
